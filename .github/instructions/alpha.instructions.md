# Coding Guidelines and Context

## Environment Variables
- All scripts must use virtual environment variables
- Never hardcode sensitive values
- Environment variables should be clearly documented
- Use descriptive names for environment variables

## Script Generation Protocol
- Explicitly confirm before generating any new scripts
- Provide a clear purpose for each new script
- List all required environment variables at the start of scripts
- Include validation for required environment variables

## Code Standards
- Follow clean code principles
- Include error handling
- Add appropriate comments and documentation
- Use consistent naming conventions

## Implementation Requirements
1. Every script must validate environment variables before execution
2. New script generation requires explicit user confirmation
3. Document dependencies and prerequisites
4. Include usage examples in script documentation
